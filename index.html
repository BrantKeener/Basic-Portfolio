                    I am currently working to strenthen my skills as a web developer. This industry allows for both immense creativity, and life-long learning. As I continue to hone my skills, I can see that this industry requires creativity not only in the actual design, but in the implementation of a website. By continually working with others, we are able to design truely novel approaches in the information age.

                    At this time, I am working as a Medical Laboratory Scientist working at the University of Colorado Hospital Anschutz Medical Campus. This work is extremely interesting and rewarding. My curret work invovles transfusion medicine, and the transfusion of blood products and their derivatives.
